    <h2>The One-Sided Encounters</h2>
    
    <h3>The First Sihoutte meet</h3>
    <!--(p style) inline-high preference-->
    <p class="chapter3colors"> One day, during our college industrial visit, we found ourselves on the shores of a beautiful beach. The salty breeze, the sound of crashing waves â€“ it was a moment etched in memory and then later we decided to take a quick auto ride back home. I was with my friends, chatting and having fun. As we were rushing, we passed by your college.

        In the midst of our laughter and chatter, passing by the college grounds, a friend pointed and exclaimed, "There, by the side of the college platform, you were walking with a friend of yours. I was curious, so I turned hastily around to get a better look. But it was quite far, and all I could see was a crowd of people.
        
        It was the first time I saw you not exactly but atleast your silhoutte, even though it was just a quick glance from a distance

<h3>The First and Last Meet!</h3>
<p id="detailedcolors" class="chapter3colors">
   After 2 years of wandering, It was July 8 2023 12.02pm. The sky that day really was the brightest I had ever seen it!
    The world was alive with the buzz of everyday life, but for me, that moment held a magic of its own.

And there you were, standing near the metro entrance, bathed in the sunlight. Your phone pressed against your ear, lost in conversation. As I took every step in huge shock and surprise, you swiftly moved to my left. A question danced in your eyes, and you hurriedly sought guidance from a nearby shopkeeper, as if chasing an address.

Our paths collided, and there you were, right beside me. I couldn't blink; I didn't want to miss a single detail. A black dress, A backpack and A phone. As you passed, the air itself seemed like a hurricane letting me feel the air. You walked towards the right, unaware of the silent spectator that I was.

In that fleeting moment, I saw you up close, the person who had unknowingly become my inspired muse. The world seemed to hush, allowing me to savor the beauty of that simple, ordinary encounter.
